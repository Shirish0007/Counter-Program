# Counter Program

Welcome to my Counter Program project! This project marks my first venture into web development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Counter Program is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to increment or decrement a numerical value with the click of a button. 

## Features

- **Increment and Decrement Buttons:** Users can increase or decrease the counter value by clicking the respective buttons.
- **Customizable Styling:** The Counter Program features a clean and minimalist design, customizable through CSS to suit personal preferences or integrate with other projects.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with responsiveness in mind, the Counter Program adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## Getting Started

To try out the Counter Program, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No additional setup or installation is required. Experiment with the counter, explore the codebase, and feel free to customize and expand upon the project to further your learning journey in web development.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to express my gratitude to the online tutorials, documentation resources, and community forums that provided invaluable guidance and support throughout the development of this project.
